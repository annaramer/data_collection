### Overview
This project involves web scraping data related to Mars from various websites and analyzing it using Python. The primary tasks include scraping titles and preview text from Mars news articles and analyzing Mars weather data. The project aimed to strengthen skills in collecting, organizing, analyzing, and visually communicating data insights.

## The project consists of two main parts:

### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

- Utilized automated browsing with Splinter to visit the Mars news site.
- Scraped titles and preview text of news articles.
- Stored the scraping results in Python data structures.
- Stored the scraped data in a JSON file.

### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

- Used automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
